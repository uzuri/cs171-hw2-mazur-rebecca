My intention here was to give a "slice of time" view of the existing graph.

What you should get here is a mini-version of the existing graph (all lines) that you can select portions of to then be presented with a cut-away view of that time period showing which branches were active.

I thought this might be an interesting take on the graph; I know sometimes when working on a project you know when you last had it working and might like to go back then and try to snag the working content and see what might have flubbed up what you have currently live.
