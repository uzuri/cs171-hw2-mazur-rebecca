My intention here was to give a "slice of time" view of the existing graph.

What you should get here is a mini-version of the existing graph (all lines) that you can select portions of to then be presented with a cut-away view of that time period showing which branches were active.

I thought this might be an interesting take on the graph; I know sometimes when working on a project you know when you last had it working and might like to go back then and try to snag the working content and see what might have flubbed up what you have currently live.  This gives you a quick way to get back to that slides of time and grab whatever changes might have been going on then.

I'm disappointed in the finished product, though; it really doesn't seem that useful.  I mean, it works; you can see when there are a lot of commits in a certain time period; you can see when there's a few, that's very clearly shown by the bubbles, and the colors make it clear which section of the graph you're hanging around in (and the bubbles correspond to the author branch so you can clearly map one to the other).  I don't think it's necessarily breaking any rules (though perhaps bars would be better than bubbles... they'd certainly be easier to mouseover, but I piced the bubbles because they had a sort of mental connection to taking a slice through the graph if you were to envision the grpah connections as pipes), it just seems to be lacking something.  

I'm running out of time or I might have looked into some other type of vis altogether.
