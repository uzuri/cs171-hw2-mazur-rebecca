	1. Contribution Calendar:  This would be a useful tool for PMs or other managers (whose teams use GitHub) when looking for performance metrics -- how often has this person been contributing, when -- with the gotcha that the person being alanlyzed didn't have to be contributing to the projects that you think are important!  That data isn't shown.  This makes a specifc call to contributions_calendar_data, which I'm having a bit of difficulty finding in the documetnation of the API.  For this one, the extremely productive day scenerio doesn't affect much -- the fellow will have a particularly green square.  Now unfortunately that square probably won't be any greener than a moderately productive day, so it might be worth while to make the scale used for deciding color more dynamic (so greenest is always most, rather than cut-off point, which seems to be where it is now).  On the other hand, it may well be that the cutoff point is the best way to represent an extremely productive day, as the extended scale would make other, moderately productive days looks like nothing!  It may well be that "did more than the average bear" is all that's important here.
